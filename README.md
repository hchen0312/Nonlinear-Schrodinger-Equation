# Nonlinear-Schrodingers-Equation
Solving nonlinear Schrodinger's equation using split step Fourier method with 4th order R-K

This solver considered 2 to 6 orders of dispersions, Kerr effects, self-steepening, loss, and Raman effect.

The code took AlN waveguide pumped near 800 nm with a series of 100 fs pulse as an example. Dispersion is anomalous near 800 nm.

All parameters are straight forward and physical
